<h2>Changing the Face of Technology</h2>
<p>Who do you think created some of the most unique and facsinating historical technological advances? Countless women have been responsible for producing technological feats, yet many are not acknowloged. More often then not, when you read about science, technology, and computers, men's names are readily available. This gender disparity results from selective story telling by historians and organizations employing industry females.    
<p>The story of Jean Bartik and the ENIAC completely throws those common "males are the successful ones in science" assumptions out the window!</p>
